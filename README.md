# MARIA: A novel bioinformatics toolkit making on Golang to clean sequences

**MARIA** An ultrafast, multithreaded bioinformatics toolkit developed in Go, designed for efficient preprocessing and cleaning of raw sequencing data from **Illumina**, **Oxford Nanopore**, **PacBio**, and **Ion Torrent** technologies.

**Why MARIA?**

- My heart: _"This tool bears the name of the one who gave me half of my life, twenty-three chromosomes of profound love, and the eternal breath of her glowing mitochondria. Thanks to you, **Katlenth MarÃ­a Esdrina Carranza Montesdeoca**, I am what I am, because your essence vibrates in every cell of me"._
- Anthropology: MarÃ­a is one of the most common names in the world.
- Symbolism: Purity, maternal love, humility, and faith.

### Recommendations Based on RAM and Number of Cores

This document describes the optimal `chunkSize` for cleaning DNA/RNA sequences (FASTQ or FASTA format) on systems with limited resources.

| Available RAM | CPU Cores | Recommended Chunk Size (reads) | Estimated Memory per Thread |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| â‰¤ 4 GB        | 2â€“4       | 500 â€“ 1,000                    | ~200â€“400 KB                 |
| 4 â€“ 8 GB      | 2â€“4       | 1,000 â€“ 5,000                  | ~400 KB â€“ 2 MB              |
| > 8 GB        | â‰¥ 4       | 5,000 â€“ 10,000+                | > 2 MB                      |

### Notes

- Each FASTQ read contains 4 lines (identifier, bases, separator, quality scores).
- Estimated memory usage: 1 read â‰ˆ 400 bytes.
- Using larger chunks may improve performance on machines with ample RAM, but may cause bottlenecks or swapping on limited systems.
- It is recommended to start testing with `chunkSize = 1000` and adjust based on system behavior.

## ðŸ›  Generate plugins

```bash
go build -buildmode=plugin -o plugins/compressFile.so plugins/compressFile.go
go run main.go -plugins=compressFile,customPlugin
```
